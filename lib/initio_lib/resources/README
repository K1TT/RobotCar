Servo demon servod from ServoBlaster project:
=============================================

initio_lib uses the servo demon servod from the ServoBlaster project
to control the position of the Tilt/Plan servos.

The default call of servod is as follows:

  sudo servod --pcm --idle-timeout=20000 -p1pins="18,22" > /dev/null

with the concretely chosen binary depending on the PATH environment
variable. One can customise the version/location of servod by setting
the environment variable SERVOD. For example:

  export SERVOD=/usr/local/bin/servod

The communication with servod works by writing commands to 

  /dev/servoblaster


For convenience, this folder includes a binary of servod.
If this binary does not run on a particular system, one might re-compile
it from its sources.

Header files from the wiringPi project:
=======================================

The following header files are copied from the wiringPi project:

softPwm.h
wiringPi.h

These header files are just provided for convenience to allow compilation of
initio_lib on non-RaspberryPI machines. To use the library on the RaspberryPI
one needs to properly install wiringPi, including its dynamic loaded libraries.
