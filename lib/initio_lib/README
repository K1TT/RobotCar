author:  Raimund Kirner, University of Hertfordshire

         Version 2.1, February 1999
         (for details see LICENSE file)

Dependencies of this library:
o wiringPi
  http://wiringpi.com
  (needs to be downloaded and installed locally)
o ServoBlaster
  https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster
  (instead of compiling it from source, a binary for 
   RaspberryPI is included.)


Download:
  $> git clone https://github.com/rkirner/initio_lib
  $> cd initio_lib

Installation:
Simply type:

  $> make install

This compiles the library and copies the files into
  /usr/local/include
  /usr/local/lib

Please check whether your system has /usr/local/lib in the dynamic
library path.  If not, adding the line
  /usr/local/lib
into the file '/etc/ld.so.conf' might help, with running afterwards
  $> sudo ldconfig

Put the ServoBlaster binary in search path:
  $> sudo cp ./resources/servod /usr/local/bin/
(make sure that "/usr/local/bin/" is listed in your PATH environment variable)

Optional: Some examples use the ncurses library.
If you don't have it installed, you might want to install it
(might need to update version in future):
  $> sudo apt-get install libncurses5
  $> sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Development notes:
This library has been heavily inspired by the original Python version
provided by Gareth Davies, Sep 2013. While care has been taken to
keep the interface similar, one should check the differences when
porting sample programs to C.
